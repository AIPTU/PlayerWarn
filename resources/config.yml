  # Default value: 5
  delay: 5

  # The `message` option specifies the warning message template to be sent to the player.
  # The `{delay}` placeholder will be replaced with the actual delay time in seconds.
  # You can use color codes by using "§" or "&" before the color code.
  # Default value: '&cYou have reached the warning limit. You will be punished in {delay} seconds.'
  message: "&cYou have reached the warning limit. You will be punished in {delay} seconds."

  # The `broadcast_to_everyone` option enables or disables broadcasting warning events to all players on the server.
  # Set to true to enable broadcasting, or false to disable it.
  # When enabled, all players will be notified when a warning is issued.

# Punishment settings
punishment:
  # The `type` option specifies the type of punishment to apply when a player reaches the warning limit.
  # Valid options are "kick", "ban", "ban-ip", and "none".
  # - "kick": Kicks the player from the server when the warning limit is reached.
  # - "ban": Bans the player from the server when the warning limit is reached.
  # - "ban-ip": Bans the player's IP address from the server when the warning limit is reached.
  # - "tempban": Temporarily bans the player from the server when the warning limit is reached.
  # - "none": No punishment will be applied when the warning limit is reached.
  # Default value is "none".
  type: none

  # The `tempban` option specifies the duration of the temporary ban.
  # This is only used if `type` is set to "ban" and you want it to be temporary (handled in command usually, but here for global setting if expanded).
  # Actually, for PlayerWarn, tempban is usually a specific punishment type or handled via arguments.
  # Let's add "tempban" as a valid type above.
  # Valid options are "kick", "ban", "ban-ip", "tempban", and "none".

  # Duration for "tempban" punishment type (e.g., "1 day", "12 hours", "30 minutes").
