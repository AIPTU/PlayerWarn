9. **Configurable Warning Messages**: Customize warning messages sent to players upon receiving a warning or upon warning expiration.
10. **Configurable Punishment Messages**: Define custom messages for each punishment type, displayed when punishments are applied.
11. **Pending Punishments**: Queue pending punishments for offline players, ensuring they are applied upon login.
12. **Ease of Management**: Use commands to issue warnings, remove warnings, clear all warnings for a player, and view warning history.
